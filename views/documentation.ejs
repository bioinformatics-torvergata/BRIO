	Brio is a webserver for the identification of known protein interaction motifs in RNA molecules. We collected sequence and secondary structure RNA motifs identified in CLIP, HITS-CLIP, PARCLIP and eCLIP experiments (Adinolfi et al., 2019) and these motifs are searched into the input RNA sequences and/or secondary structure. 
	<br><br>
	The search is performed with a BEAM-derived method (Pietrosanto et al., 2016).<br>
	BRIO is able to find the best match for the collections of sequence and structure ungapped motifs starting from RNA sequences or structures using the search tool based on <a href="http://beam.uniroma2.it/home">BEAM</a>.
	<br><br>
	BRIO uses the same engine of BEAM, in particular: <br>
	- Each query sequence is aligned with the motif models' Position Frequency Matrix in the chosen realm (secondary structure -in BEAR- or sequence).
	<br>
	- The starting alignment position with the highest ungapped alignment score is reported and a score is considered valid if its value is over the motif threshold, which is the minimum score of the core elements forming the motif extracted by BEAM.

	BRIO collects motifs that have been identified in protein-RNA binding experiments involving 181 RNA binding proteins (RBPs), 131 of which are composed of one or more known RNA binding domains. <br><br>

	The list of all the motifs collected (Adinolfi et al., 2019) are schematized in the table below.
	<br>
	<table id="motif_table">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>motifs</th>
				<th>4804</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>sequence motifs</td>
				<td>2296 (2112 hg19 + 184 mm9)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>structure motifs</td>
				<td>2508 (2319 hg19 + 189 mm9)</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
